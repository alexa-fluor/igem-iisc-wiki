          That question is answerable from solved structures before any further cloning. Our

          the same C-terminal residue, Ala859, with relative SASA 0.028 / 0.000 / 0.000 and

            question for our own construct directly. The structure file has not yet been put

          Human Practices work and for the clinician questionnaire: it is a specific,
          government-sourced claim about why continued vector-control work is still warranted,
          rather than a general appeal to malaria being bad. The remaining burden is smaller and
          skewed toward the more dangerous species.

          Applied to indoor residual spraying at its published cost ($8.26 per person per year,
          Alonso 2021) and efficacy (57%, Mpangala 2021), the model's formula reproduces the
          published Tanzanian figure of $152.36 per case averted (Stelmach 2018) to the right
          order of magnitude at Tanzania's actual transmission intensity: $97 at API 150, $145 at

          The steric model treats a folded tag as a rigid isotropic sphere, and GFP is really a
          24 × 42 Å barrel. It screens for gross clashes; it is not a free-energy calculation and
          will not catch subtle folding or allosteric effects. The projection direction is a
          geometric heuristic modelling a plausible worst-case resting position, not a
          Boltzmann-weighted ensemble over what a flexible linker actually samples. Treat the
          output as a ranking of which construct to build first, not as a substitute for a
          binding assay.

        <P>
          The cost model assumes equal coverage between the compared interventions and takes
          efficacy as a single proportional reduction in incidence. It does not model the
          bait-station delivery mechanism, coverage decay, or any dynamics over time.
