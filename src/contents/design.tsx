          The cargo never has to be injected or secreted as a bare molecule. It leaves inside an

          side effect: HlyF sits behind the strong ribosome binding site on{" "}

          protein.
        </P>
        <P>
          Degrading those precursors does two things at once. It destabilises the membrane,
          which raises vesicle production sharply, and it shifts the membrane's composition
          toward a eukaryotic one — which is what lets the vesicle fuse with a mosquito cell at
          the other end.

        <P>
          On the way out, the signal peptidase recognises the fusion protein's N-terminal signal
          sequence and cleaves it, so what ends up in the vesicle is the mature protein with its

        <P>
          The obvious way to picture the device is an entry hole sized so a mosquito walks in and
          a bee stays out. There is no published, field-validated hole diameter that does that
          reliably, and commercial field-trial stations avoid the problem entirely by not using

          What does have a number behind it is membrane feeding. A 2025 study in <i>Insects</i>{" "}
          used a microneedle roller to punch perforations under 0.25 mm in film over the bait.
          Mosquito stylets are 10–50 µm and probe straight through; a honeybee's lapping glossa
          needs an open liquid surface at 100–200 µm, and a butterfly's coiled proboscis is
          larger still. The reported result was 85–86% mosquito feeding and 0% bee and butterfly
          feeding. The field-deployed Westham "Zumba" station, used in WHO-tracked Phase III
          trials in Mali, Kenya and Zambia, works on the same principle with an SEBS elastomer
          membrane.
