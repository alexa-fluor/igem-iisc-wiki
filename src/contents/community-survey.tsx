        <P>
          Malaria remains one of the largest infectious disease burdens in the world, and India carries a substantial share of it. Current control relies mainly on insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. Their effectiveness is increasingly limited by insecticide resistance, and the public’s view of these tools shapes how any new approach would be received. Before a technology such as ours could be considered, it is important to understand what people already know and believe.
        </P>
        <P>
          As part of the MOSKATEER project, an engineered bacterium that lives in Anopheles mosquitoes is being developed to disrupt their reproduction and reduce malaria transmission. Because this approach is new to most people, the way it is explained and perceived matters as much as the science itself. We therefore designed a short community awareness survey to capture public and professional views before the technology is tested.
        </P>
        <P>
          The survey asked about four areas: how aware respondents are of malaria as a public health issue, how they judge current control methods and whether those methods will be enough without new tools, what they already know about genetic and biological approaches to mosquito control, and whether they would support a supervised pilot once safety testing and regulatory approval are in place. Several questions tested understanding directly, including how gene-based methods are meant to work and whether the term “paratransgenesis” was familiar, so we could separate awareness from misconception.
        </P>
        <P>
          Responses were collected anonymously and used only for this research. The survey is intended as a baseline. It tells us where public understanding stands, which concepts need clearer explanation, and where concerns are concentrated, so that our outreach and any future pilot planning address real questions rather than assumed ones.
