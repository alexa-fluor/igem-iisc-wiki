    question: "Do Asaia cells recovered from the sugar matrix regrow into colonies at a rate comparable to cells that never entered it, and does time in the matrix change that?",
    ifA: "Counts falling dramatically or to zero, whatever the incubation time, would mean the matrix is simply lethal and the delivery concept needs redesigning before any further work.",
    ifB: "Counts close to the unexposed control would mean the cells enter a metabolically inactive but viable state and resume growth once the osmotic stress is removed — still a viable delivery vehicle.",
    changes: "A time-dependent decline would point to a slow cumulative stress rather than an immediate kill, and would set how long a field trap could run before it needs refreshing.",

  },
  {
    id: "transformation",
    n: "2",
    question: "Did the engineered plasmid go into E. coli, and do the colonies that survived selection actually carry it?",
    ifA: "Colonies on the selection plate with no band of the expected size would mean survival on the plate is not evidence of the construct.",
    ifB: "Colonies carrying a PCR band of the predicted size would mean the transformation worked and there is material to verify properly.",
    changes: "Everything downstream starts from a verified colony, so this is the gate the rest of the work passes through.",
    status: "awaiting",
  },
  {
    id: "purity",
    n: "3",
    question: "Is it exactly the plasmid we designed, and is the DNA clean enough to trust in sensitive downstream work?",
    ifA: "A digest pattern that does not match the predicted map would catch a wrong insert size, a missing insert or a rearrangement that a PCR band alone would have hidden.",
    ifB: "A matching digest pattern with A260/280 and A260/230 ratios in the expected range would mean both identity and purity are established.",
    changes: "If a later experiment gives an unexpected result, this is what lets us say it was not simply a wrong or dirty plasmid.",

  {
    id: "glycerol",
    n: "4",
    question: "Does the verified construct survive freezing, so later work starts from the same material?",
    ifA: "Poor recovery from a thawed stock would mean re-deriving material each time, with the variability that brings.",
    ifB: "Clean recovery would mean one verified stock underlies every later experiment.",
    changes: "This is what makes results across weeks comparable to each other.",
    status: "awaiting",
  },
  {
    id: "pulldown",
    n: "5",
    question: "Is the fusion protein expressed, and is the band we pull down the protein we designed?",
    ifA: "No band, or a band at the wrong size, would send us back to expression conditions or to the construct itself.",
    ifB: "A band at the predicted size, present in the tagged sample and absent from the untagged control, would confirm expression of the fusion.",
    changes: "Delivery cannot be tested until there is a protein to deliver, so this gates the OMV work.",
    status: "awaiting",
  },
  {
    id: "omv",
    n: "6",
    question: "Do OMVs get taken up by epithelial cells, and does the dsRNA cargo arrive with them?",
    ifA: "Uptake without cargo delivery would separate the two halves of the problem and point the design at the cargo, not the vesicle.",
    ifB: "Uptake with cargo detected inside the cells would be the first direct evidence for the delivery route the whole project rests on.",
    changes: "This is the experiment closest to the project's central claim, and the one whose result most changes what comes next.",

        <P>
          The habit of stating the question first paid off in ways we did not fully appreciate
          until later. It made troubleshooting targeted, because an ambiguous result could be
          traced to a specific assumption rather than to the experiment as a whole. And it made
          the work much easier to explain to people outside the project, including judges, since
          the logic behind each experiment is stated up front rather than left implicit.
        </P>
        <P>
          It also changed what we ran. Several questions were answered on a computer first —
          whether the construct plausibly folds, whether the bacterium can afford to express it,
          how far apart traps would have to be — so that the bench work started with fewer open
          questions. That work is on the <a href="/model">Model page</a>.
