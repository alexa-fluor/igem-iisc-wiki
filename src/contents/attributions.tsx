        <P>
          The wiki is a React and Vite application. Every figure is generated from the project's
          own illustration system rather than drawn by hand, so a change to the style tokens
          changes every figure at once. The fonts are self-hosted and no assets are loaded from
          outside iGEM's own static host.
