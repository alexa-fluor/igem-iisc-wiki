          One plasmid carries the whole system: an inducible promoter, a vesicle-forming helper
          protein, the fusion protein that grips and ferries the cargo, and the cargo itself as a
          circularised RNA. Expression is driven from P<i>tac</i> under LacI control, so the
          construct is off until it is induced.

            Several features carry warnings in the GenBank file that are worth repeating here:
            the <i>lacI</i> CDS has a native GTG start that should not be "corrected" to ATG, the
            242 bp <i>lacI</i>–P<i>tac</i> intergenic region is kept verbatim, the lac operator
            O1 must not be moved, and neither twister ribozyme may be trimmed. The HlyF codons
            are provisional and are to be regenerated before synthesis.

          The two coding sequences downstream of P<i>tac</i> are not meant to be expressed
          equally. HlyF sits behind the strong Registry RBS and the fusion protein behind the
          weak one, so the vesicle machinery runs ahead of the cargo-binding protein rather than
          competing with it for the cell's capacity.
