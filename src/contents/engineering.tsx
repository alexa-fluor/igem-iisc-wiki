          Both of the projects below went through a genuine design-build-test-learn cycle. The
          first one we did not carry forward; documenting it here shows the breadth of what we
          explored and the kind of reasoning that eventually shaped how we approached MOSKATEER
          itself.
        </P>
        <P>
          The through-line in both is the same instinct our mentors kept pushing during
          ideation: ask the answerable question first, and let its answer tell you whether the
          bigger question is worth pursuing yet.

        <P>
          Our starting point was not a bacterium or a gene — it was a question about
          agricultural loss. Heatwaves have roughly tripled in frequency since 1960, and even
          short heat spikes during sensitive growth stages like flowering can cut yield by
          10–40%. India's own 2022 heatwave produced a documented 10–15% drop in wheat output.
          That was the scale of problem we wanted a design to be able to move.
        </P>
        <H3>The biology: heat, ACC, ethylene</H3>
        <P>
          Heat stress at the root level, roughly 35 °C and above, makes plants synthesise more
          ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) via the enzyme ACS, and export it into the
          apoplast and rhizosphere. The plant's own apoplastic ACC oxidase converts ACC into
          ethylene — a useful hormone in modest amounts. Under prolonged heat stress, elevated
          ACC output means elevated ethylene, and excess ethylene amplifies growth inhibition
          and accelerates senescence. The plant over-produces its own stress hormone and
          compounds the damage.
        </P>
        <Pull>
          The problem was not heat, which we could not do anything about. It was the flood of
          ethylene signalling that heat triggers.
        </Pull>
        <H3>Why the rhizosphere, not the plant</H3>
        <P>
          Ethylene signalling regulates several developmental pathways at once, so modifying
          the plant's own hormone machinery risked pleiotropic effects in processes we were not
          trying to touch. The rhizosphere is a naturally microbe-populated interface plants
          already interact with constantly, so engineering a microbe to act there gave
          localised, stress-dependent control of ACC without altering the plant's genome.
        </P>
        <Note label="The same logic as MOSKATEER">
          <p>
            Rather than editing the organism we ultimately wanted to protect, we engineered a
            bacterium to act as an intermediary at a natural interface. The biology is entirely
            different; the design reasoning is the same one that produced MOSKATEER.

        <P>
          Most straightforwardly engineered strains use constitutive promoters, which drain the
          bacterium's energy continuously — so the population dies off or sporulates before the
          heatwave it was meant to answer ever arrives. A high-expression deaminase that is not
          kinetically tuned strips out essentially all of the plant's ACC, producing what we
          called <b>ethylene blindness</b>, where the plant can no longer regulate root growth
          or immune signalling at all. Laboratory strains generally lack a safety leash. And a
          genetically uniform population under stress responds uniformly — all active and
          starving, or all dormant — leaving the plant unprotected in exactly the window that
          matters.

                  relative to how little ACC is present, the system produces a partial reduction
                  of about 50–60% rather than total depletion — enough to blunt the excess, while

        <H3>What happens to the ACC afterwards</H3>
        <P>
          A design that solves the signalling problem is still incomplete if it introduces a new
          one. ACC deaminase converts ACC into α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Both are ecologically
          unremarkable: ACC-deaminase-producing rhizobacteria are widely reported to improve
          plant growth under stress with no evidence of phytotoxic accumulation, and soil
          ecosystems already contain ammonia in parts-per-million ranges as part of ordinary
          microbial nitrogen cycling.
