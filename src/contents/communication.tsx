        <P>
          A short share video introduces the project in thirty seconds, and a longer piece walks
          through RNA interference itself, grounded in actual structures rather than cartoons.
          Both were scripted first and storyboarded against the illustration system, so the
          figures on this wiki and the frames in the video say the same thing.
        </P>
        <P>
          Alongside them we ran a nationwide quiz with SciAstra, which put malaria and synthetic
          biology questions in front of a much larger audience than any event we could host
          ourselves.
        </P>

          <p>
            Video files and the recordings from the 10 October event are not on this page yet.
            They are listed in the project's own write-up as material to attach, and this section
            is where they go.
